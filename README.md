Introduction
As Satralon Limited continues its efforts to strengthen workforce efficiency and drive better business performance, this employee data analysis project is designed to offer meaningful insights into the company’s human capital. By examining employee data spanning from 2018 to 2023, the analysis will highlight key trends, uncover patterns, and identify areas for strategic improvement.
Aim of the Project
The primary goals of this project are to:
1.	Understand employee demographics and characteristics – Analyze data related to employee age, tenure, department, and job role to build a comprehensive profile of the workforce.
2.	Identify factors influencing employee turnover – Examine the underlying causes of staff attrition and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance retention.
3.	Inform talent management decisions – Generate insights that support more effective recruitment, training, and employee development strategies.
Problems Being Addressed
This analysis focuses on addressing the following key challenges within Satralon Limited:
1.	Employee retention – The company is currently facing difficulties in retaining high-performing employees and reducing overall turnover.
2.	Skills gap – There is a need to pinpoint existing gaps in skills and design tailored training initiatives to address them.
3.	Diversity and inclusion – Satralon Limited is committed to fostering a more diverse and inclusive workplace and requires data to guide progress in this area.
Data Limitations and Bias
1.	Data quality – The completeness and accuracy of historical data may vary, potentially affecting the reliability of certain findings.
2.	Biases – Existing biases in past hiring, promotion, or termination practices may be reflected in the data and could influence the interpretation of results.

What Success Means to the Company
Higher employee engagement and satisfaction scores.
Reduced turnover rates and improved retention.
Improved training effectiveness with measurable performance outcomes.

Potential Analysis & Questions
1. What is the performance distribution across different employment types (Full-Time, Contract, Part-Time)?
2. Are Production department employees more likely to be on PIP (Performance Improvement Plans) compared to IT or Sales employees?
3. Which Business Units (e.g., NEL, BPC, etc.) have the highest proportion of employees exceeding expectations?
4. Among different races, who has the highest employee satisfaction or engagement scores?
5. What is the turnover rate by department type (especially in IT/IS and Production)?
6. How does marital status affect employee satisfaction or turnover rates?
Potential Insights
The Production department appears to account for the majority of the workforce. It will be important to investigate how this department's employee satisfaction, engagement, and performance scores compare to others.
There seems to be a heavy mix of Contract and Part-Time employees compared to Full-Time staff. It will be necessary to analyze how employment type affects training participation, engagement levels, and retention.
Performance ratings show that a large percentage of employees are rated as “Fully Meets,” but relatively fewer are in the “Exceeds” category. Further analysis can uncover whether there are departments or employee types consistently achieving higher performance.

In-Analysis Observations
Headcount & Status: 1,424 total employees, of which 1,230 (86.4%) are active and 194 (13.6%) are terminated.
Employment Types: Roughly even split: Contract 461 (32.4%), Full Time 497 (34.9%), Part Time 466 (32.7%).
Performance Distribution: “Fully Meets” dominates at 78.5%, followed by “Exceeds” 12.9%, “Needs Improvement” 5.3%, and “PIP” 3.3%.
Training Spend Allocation: $793,891 total—78% ($620,568) goes to “Fully Meets,” 12.8% ($101,939) to “Exceeds,” 5.5% to “Needs Improvement,” 3.5% to “PIP”.
Department Concentration: Production leads with 959 employees (67%), then IT/IS 200 (14%), Sales 160 (11%), others smaller.
Geographic Skew: Massachusetts (MA) accounts for 1,254 employees (88%), all other states combined just 12%.
Demographics: Race is evenly spread (Asian 21%, Black 20%, Other 20%, White 20%, Hispanic 19%). Age peaks in 57–66 (19%) and 67–76 (16%).
Satisfaction Scores: Fairly uniform across 1–5 ratings (each roughly 19–21% of employees).
In-Analysis Insights and Recommendations
MA Dependency Risk: With 88% in one state, any local disruption could heavily impact operations—recommend evaluating recruitment in underrepresented states.
Training Spend Imbalance: “Fully Meets” group consumes most training budget despite middling performance—consider reallocating toward “Exceeds” to boost high-potential retention.
Undertrained PIP Group: Although small (47 employees), PIP per capita spend is highest; targeted, cost-effective coaching programs could drive better improvement.
Production Focus: As Production comprises two-thirds of the workforce, rolling out department-specific upskilling (e.g., Lean/Six Sigma) may yield broad performance gains.
Aging Workforce: Large cohorts in 57–76 age bands signal upcoming retirements—initiate succession planning and internal mentorship.
Uniform Satisfaction: Flat satisfaction suggests hidden pain points—deploy pulse surveys by department to uncover variation.

FINAL INSIGHTS AND OBSERVATIONS
Production Department Dominance
The Production Department has 1910 employees, making up approximately 67.1% of the total workforce. The company's operational success heavily relies on the performance, engagement, and stability of the Production workforce
High Proportion of Contract and Part-Time Workers
Contract (951 employees) and Part-Time (897 employees) workers together account for about 65% of the workforce.
The company has a flexible workforce model, but this could lead to higher turnover rates and lower employee loyalty if not properly managed.
Limited Number of Senior and Leadership Roles
Senior roles like CIO, Directors, and Enterprise Architects have only about 11 employees each. There may be limited internal career progression opportunities or leadership succession pipelines.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.	Production Department Dominance
Prioritize targeted employee engagement, satisfaction surveys, and specialized training programs for Production staff. Focus on retention strategies, as disruptions here could severely impact business operations.
2.	High Proportion of Contract and Part-Time Workers
Develop engagement and recognition programs specifically for Contract and Part-Time employees. Consider offering pathways to full-time employment to retain top performers.
3.	Limited Number of Senior and Leadership Roles
Establish leadership development programs and fast-track promotion initiatives for high-potential employees to strengthen the leadership bench.
CONCLUSION
The analysis of employee data from 2018 to 2023 has provided Satralon Limited with valuable insights into the dynamics of its workforce. By examining key trends in employee demographics, turnover, departmental growth, and performance, this project has highlighted both strengths and areas in need of improvement within the organization’s human resource practices.
Findings from the analysis support the need for targeted strategies to enhance employee retention, close critical skills gaps, and promote greater diversity and inclusion. While the insights gained are meaningful, they must be considered in the context of the data’s limitations, including possible inaccuracies and inherent biases in historical records.
Overall, this project serves as a foundation for more informed, data-driven HR decision-making. With continued monitoring, improved data collection, and a commitment to acting on the recommendations, Satralon Limited can build a more resilient, capable, and inclusive workforce for the future.
